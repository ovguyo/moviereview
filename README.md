# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews using LSTM and CNN

A large Movie Review Dataset v1.0, which contains a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing, has been used in this task. The dataset can be found the following link.

The aim is to classify these IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. This is a binary classification task.

Firstly, LSTM, which is an often used natural language processing technique for both sentiment analysis, text classification and machine translation, has been preferred to solve this task. LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network which is capable of learning long term dependencies.
